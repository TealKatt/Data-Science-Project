Context (Draft) - Like all types of genres in games, shooting-based games fulfill the wants of a certain group of players when it comes to video games. Shooting games are often divided amongst the perspective of the player, whether the game depicts the player as a ficticious character (Third-Person) or rather the player themselves (First-Person). The shooting genre involves use of long ranged weapons. 

Ideas for graphs: 

1. Have a bar chart with the ammount of games in each genre or tag. 
2. Histogram showing an increase or decrease in FPS/Shooting games overtime
3. Filter publisher/studios who are making a majority of FPS/Shooting content and make a top 5
4. Comparing reviews of the top 3-5 genres
5. Most popular tags for FPS/Shooting
6. Compare FPS/Shooting Prices
